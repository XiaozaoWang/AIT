### JS overview

* Node:
Node is for server side js. Enable to run js outside of browser.
**Running:** node.js + REPL(?)

* Js type system:
Dynamically typed: Don’t have to declare type for compiler/interpreter.
Weakly typed: No errors if you use an operation or function on types that don’t look compatible
Interpreted: rather than compiled

* ES6:
ECMAScript is the name of the standard that JavaScript implementations are based off of.
We will use ES6.
- use the extension .mjs over .js to use ES6 modules
- OR… in package.json, add a 'type: "module"'
